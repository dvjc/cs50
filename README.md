solution sets for different problems

Week #1

	tl;dr
		Watch Week O's lecture [https://video.cs50.net/2017/fall/lectures/0]
		Program in Scratch [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/265693234/]
		Branch and upload a file [https://github.com/submit50/dvjc]
		Submit a form

	scratch minimum requirements
		Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
		Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
		Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
		Your project must use at least one sound.
		Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime.
			As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
